Chatbot for WP, using a ChatGPT-like AI to self-learn and create replies. Easy training based on the website content. Quick setup, easy installation.

== Description ==

ChatBot is an all-in-one platform to create, deploy, and track chatbots across channels, trusted by 2900+ companies.

**Create your AI chat bot in a snap and easily launch it on your website, Facebook Messenger, Slack, and more.** Integrate ChatBot with LiveChat and HelpDesk for a seamless support experience that connects live chats, conversations with AI bots, and email support tickets.

Use the ChatBot WordPress plugin to instantly add an AI chatbot and make it appear as an interactive and customizable chat widget on your website.

= End-to-end Customer Service Automation =
Automate tasks 24/7/365, without human engagement: answer support questions, generate leads, schedule meetings, get customer feedback, collect personal data, promote products and create any other custom chat flow in the ChatBot app.

= Self-learning AI Chatbot =
ChatBot uses a dedicated AI model crafted based on the content provided from your website, online store, help center, or text documentation. It learns from your business knowledge (like information about your products and services) and uses this knowledge to answer customers' questions.

= Answer Up To 80% Of Customersâ€™ Questions With AI =
ChatBot utilizes ML (machine learning), LLM (large language models), and generative AI to dynamically provide answers to questions in chats. It creates a unique and accurate AI model (AI Assist) that is strictly based on the provided data and does not rely on third-party providers like OpenAI (ChatGPT), Google Bard, or Bing AI.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is ChatBot the same as ChatGPT? =
ChatBot is an autonomous solution without dependencies on third-party providers like OpenAI (ChatGPT). ChatBot is a platform dedicated to creating customer service chatbots for businesses, while ChatGPT is a universal generative AI service, and using it for customer service requires integration with an additional chat widget interface via OpenAI API. ChatGPT canâ€™t be easily trained for specific business needs, as it requires advanced technical knowledge. In addition, ChatGPT canâ€™t be trained exclusively on the provided data, and that means that the accuracy of provided answers canâ€™t be guaranteed.
